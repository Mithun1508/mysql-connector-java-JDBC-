1)Introduction to JDBC Programming by Examples
A JDBC program comprises the following steps:
    --Allocate a Connection object, for connecting to the database server.
    --Allocate a Statement object, under the Connection created earlier, for holding a SQL command.
    --Write a SQL query and execute the query, via the Statement and Connection created.
    --Process the query result.
    --Close the Statement and Connection to free up the resources.
